# Django Upload Handling

This repo will contain several ways to handle uploads in django. 
The easiest way - doing so by a simple form and creating a /media folder is already implemented.

The accompanying forms are rudimentary.

1) uploading and handling with Models is still missing
2) under /upload.html the base for a dropzone is already present. However, the logic isn't working yet

These two steps will be added as soon as I have time to continue this.

If you decide to use any of these forms, please be sure to switch from debug to production and use proper methods of storage.
